<h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our team is creating, a 2D platformer game with a pixel art style. In this game, you take on the role of a brilliant scientist who travels through time and space, encountering different eras and cultures. However, during one of his missions, the protagonist's time machine controller malfunctions, leaving him stranded in an unfamiliar environment. To make his way back home, the scientist must navigate through various environments and solve puzzles to fix his broken controller. Each level presents new challenges and obstacles that require the player to use their critical thinking and problem-solving skills to progress. From ancient ruins to futuristic cities, the game immerses players in a world filled with adventure, danger, and discovery.</p>

<h2>Key Architectural Drivers</h2>
    <p>1) A game engine with the necessary tools must be utilized for our game.</p>
    <p>2) A platform for pixel art creation must be used for the art of the game.</p>
    <p>3) A platform for collaboration between all team members must be used.</p>

<h2>Architectural Style Choices</h2>
    <p>Two architectural styles we were considering were the Unity game engine and the Godot game engine options.</p>
    <p>Both styles contained the same collaboration platform ( Github Desktop), 2D game development support, and pixel art creation software (ASprite).</p>
    <p>However, our team decided to use the Godot game engine over Unity because Godot is a more lightweight game development platform and is more conducive to developing our 2D platformer while using minimal hardware resources. Additionally, we decided that GDScript, which is Python packaged for Godot, would be a better language to use than C#, because it is much easier to learn and would drastically speed up development time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To reiterate, the architecture design we are using to develop this game is one using the Godot game engine. We went with this design due to the fact that Godot has more convenient components that are utilized to make games with it for our purposes. One of the main issues that we have encountered is that we do not want to over-extend our efforts and end up making more than is necessary for the game. Since we lost a team member in the process of development, this is especially the case and therefore we must be cautious about using our time wisely. This brings us to the question of how we can develop this game so that it has all the capabilities we want it to have while not spreading ourselves too thin. Figuring out the answer to this question will allow us to create this software in the most efficient way possible.</p>
