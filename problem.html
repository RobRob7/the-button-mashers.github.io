    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>INTRO</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Our group is developing a video game titled &ldquo;Going Home,&rdquo; which is a 2D, retro-themed platformer with combat and puzzle elements incorporated into it. The purpose of choosing a game for our software project is that video games incorporate so many different elements of software engineering such as design, programming, prototyping, and much more. Throughout our development process, we will be able to learn about working on a large software project from start-to-finish as a group.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>STORY</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>This original video game will feature a light-hearted story of a scientist who wishes only to go home after a day of bad luck with his inventions. This scientist is a very bright person in the universe of the game. So bright, in fact, that he has managed to create a time-traveling device that allows him to go to any period without any complications. The tale begins when this scientist decides to travel back to the Prehistoric Era to find a substance, in which he has been spending much of his time researching. This substance, according to his analysis, only appears with specific conditions in the time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. He sets out on this journey and finds the substance, but he also discovers he made an oversight in his research and had found the incorrect material. After a disappointed sigh, he gathers his things and configures his device to go back home, but he is surprised by a tyrannosaurus rex. The scientist drops his device, and it drops close to the dinosaur. He doesn&rsquo;t get enough time before the creature roars and begins heading his way, unfortunately stepping right on the time-travel remote. After a stressful chase scene, the scientist finds safety and loses the T-Rex, but now realizes that he is stuck and must find the means to get back home. This is the beginning of our scientist&apos;s journey.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>ENVIRONMENTS</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The game we&rsquo;ll develop will consist of 5 different levels which will encompass 5 different time periods. We intend on including small cutscenes when the player completes a level and moves onto the next, as well as at the beginning and end of the game. We will design all the art using pixel art to create sprites and animations. We may also incorporate free game asset libraries to speed up the development process. Our first playable environment will be set in the prehistoric era, with time jumps to different eras.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>GAMEPLAY</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;At the forefront we want to implement basic side-scroller game controls such as walking, jumping, and multi-directional movement in 2D. But we also want to expand on these tried-and-true gameplay movement features. In the game we want to gradually introduce our player and main character to new and interesting movement abilities. The first ability we want to implement is a grapple tool that can propel our character across certain distances faster. This will hopefully add a skill that the player can master throughout the game. The second ability will be a character augmentation that allows them to dash forward. This gives the player a way of closing the gap with the various enemies in each level. The third ability will enable the player to double jump. These three abilities outlined will provide a fun experience and give more freedom to the players movement style.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Additionally, we will implement enemy A.I. which will have different combat patterns. One type of enemy will follow a specified path, and when the player gets close enough the enemy will engage. Another enemy type will notice the player from a certain range and begin using ranged attacks on them. To fight the enemies, the player will be equipped with multiple types of weapons, including melee and ranged weapons depending on the time period of each level. The weapons change accordingly as the scientist manages to gather more parts from the current era and improve his equipment. While this upgrade system will give the weapons a variety of appearances, there will only be two types of attack the player can perform.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Another big element in the game will be a puzzle that the player will have to solve to pass each level. At this time, we are still determining the exact puzzles that will be incorporated into our game, but puzzles will have an important place. We will animate and design each puzzle, implementing their functionality utilizing GDscript provided by the Godot engine.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>We will also include different types of obstacles, with some having different collision physics that the player will have to traverse to move forward in each level. These will be in the form of falling floors, bottomless pits, and traps.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;In conjunction with the design elements of our game, we are looking to include features such as a respawn system, a health bar system, and a functional menu and user interface in-game.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Going Home will be developed with the Godot game engine and its tools. It is a free and open-source game engine centered around lightweight, 2D and 3D game development. We will be utilizing the Godot GDScript for programming our various features outlined above. GDScript is a port of Python developed for use in the Godot game engine. The Godot engine also already incorporates asset saving to store all our assets. The art is going to be a large share of the assets in our game. We are going to use a mix between free online 2D game assets and our own original art. The software for the pixel art in our game for original content will be a pixel art drawing application called Asperite.</span></p>

    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;text-indent:.5in;'><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>We will be developing our software using the agile scrum methodology. We will be utilizing scrum since we will be able to easily manage our software development group and set timeframes/goals for the iterative implementation of new features in our game until the completion of its development.</span></p>
