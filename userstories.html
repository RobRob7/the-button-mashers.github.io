<h2>1: Exciting Gameplay</h2>
<p>As a beta-tester and gamer, I want to play a game that has an entertaining gameplay system.</p>
    <h3>1.1 Engaging Player Movement Skills</h3>

        <p>As an avid video game enjoyer, I, Arnold Palmer, want to be able to control a character with a unique set of movement skills that allows for engaing gameplay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: The user should be able to control a 2D character and perform several movement abilities. These include walking, sprinting, jumping and dashing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: The user should have a dashing ability which must take into account the various object collisions. The dash must not be able to phase through objects.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: Check collision with several game objects (platforms, walls, enemies), and make sure the player character responds accordingly, i.e., does not phase through objects; the objects must stop the character in its place right before object position.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>1.2 Higher Engagement with Enemy Mobs</h3>

        <p>As a beta-tester, I, Tom Sanchez, want the game to implement a mechanic for hostile entities to react accordingly to the player's presence in order to accomplish a higher level of user engagement, dynamic gameplay, and overall more fun interactions playing the game.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: Enemy entities should have the ability to act accordingly when a player enters a certain range of detection. Once a player has been detected by an enemy, the enemy should attempt to attack the player in a more directed motion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: The enemy mobs in the game should not be able to detect the player in unrealistic scenarios, such as if the player is behind it or on a different floor. Enemies should not follow a player off of platforms or when the player has changed floors. Enemies should lose the player when this happens and not follow until detection occurs once again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance test: Perform a test on the detection capabilities of the enemy entities by moving the player closely behind it and waiting for it to turn around and detect the them. Perform another test in which the player is placed in a different floor from the enemy, and then proceeds to detect the player when the player jumps onto the floor descends onto it. Once detection has occurred, the enemy entity should follow the player, attempting to attack it. Lastly verify that the enemy will not follow once it has lost track of the player.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>1.3 Bigger variety of Enemy Entities</h3>

        <p>As a videogame reviewer, I, Kent Brown, want a game that will not have repetitive enemies so that I can enjoy an experience that will always have me facing new dangers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: There should be a bigger number of enemy types that we can encounter, and they should feel like a different enemy with distinct mechanisms to the rest of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: Any enemy that is added should still be fitting to the current setting of the game. If an enemy is added that does not make sense to the story progression or overall gameplay, it should be removed or worked on to apply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 7 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: For any given area of the game, there should be at least two different types of enemies that make sense to the player and the game.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2: UI Elements</h2> 
<p>As a user interface enthusiast, I want to see a game with a well implemented UI.</p>
    <h3>2.1 Intuitive User Interface</h3>

        <p>As a user interface enthusiast, I, Juniper John, want to see a video game that has an easy-to-use user interface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: There should be a main menu that incorporates a start button, options button and a quit button. Additionally there should be a pause menu in-game that shows a resume button, a settings/options button to change control settings. Controller functionality should be a goal for this project.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: None</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: Game can be paused mid-game, controls can be switched from keyboard and mouse to controller, resolution, frames, etc can be changed, and all the buttons work to start the game from the main menu, quit the game entirely, and resume the game after pausing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>2.2 Implementing a Gameplay U.I.</h3>

        <p>As a beta-tester, I, Kendra Evans, want to be able to see important features that give more information to the player about their current condition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: The game should be able to display some sort of meter to show the amount of health the player has remaining, and it should also display a score-keeping number of sorts to show the points obtained from picking up items and dealing with enemy entities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: These U.I. elements should be added to the gameplay in a way that they are not disruptive to the player&rsquo;s field of view and the information displayed should be meaningful and necessary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: At any moment that the player can see themselves in the game world, then they should also be able to see their current health bar and the number of points accumulated. These numbers should also remain consistent even if a player exits an area of the game.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3: Story Elements</h2>
<p>As a storytelling enjoyer, I want to see a game with a well implemented story.</p>
    <h3>3.1 Story Focus</h3>   

        <p>As an enjoyer of storytelling, I, James Alfonso, would like to see the story to be well developed and told well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>>Elaboration: As this game will include a story to go along with gameplay it will be important to plan out how the story will interact with the game&rsquo;s progress. Thus making it important that the story and gameplay go well together through proper planning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: The story is not the most important thing to make a functioning game but is important to have so the game feels good to progress through.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: Proper story editing as well as making sure that the gameplay ties into the plot throughout the game.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>4: Art/Animation</h2>
<p>As a passionate artist, I want to play a video game that is visually sound.</p>
    <h3>4.1 Art</h3>

        <p>As a passionate artist and gamer, I, James Conn, would like to play a video game that with an exciting art style.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: The user should feel like the game they are playing has a unique world as the backdrop. They should feel like they are transported into another reality.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: To deal with the time it takes to create original art, there should be a focus on premade art assets that are similar to each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: The games world feels exciting and distracts the user from their real world issues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h3>4.2 Animation</h3>

        <p>As a lover of animations, I, Jaime Conwell, would like to play a video game that contains detailed animations of the user-controlled player and environment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaboration: The animations should be fluid and convey each movement (jump, walk, sprint, dash) with purpose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Constraints: To deal with the time it takes to create meaningful animations, the frames per animation must be limited to fewer than 4.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acceptance Test: The animations of the player and environment are fluid and not janky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
