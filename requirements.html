<p><strong>1: Introduction</strong><br />1.1: Purpose of Product<br />Our group is developing a video game titled &ldquo;Going Home,&rdquo; which is a 2D, retro-themed platformer with combat and puzzle elements incorporated into it. The purpose of choosing a game for our software project is that video games incorporate so many different elements of software engineering such as design, programming, prototyping, and much more. Throughout our development process, we will be able to learn about working on a large software project from start-to-finish as a group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2: Scope of Product<br />This videogame will include several notable features that are prominent in platformer games such as a variety of movement options, distinct enemy types, unique environments to explore, engaging characters and story, and a convenient user interface design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1.3: Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions<br />User interface (U.I.): A conduit between human and computer interaction &ndash; the space where a user will interact with a computer or machine to complete tasks (Every interaction, 2017).<br />Agile Scrum Methodology: a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where the goal of each sprint is to build the most important features first and come out with a Potentially Shippable Product (Inflectra).</p>

<p><br /><strong>2: General Description of Product</strong></p>
<p>2.1: Context of Product<br />We are developing a software that deals purely with creating an experience that is entertaining and joyful to the user. Much like other games, ours will target people who are looking to get something that will allow them to pass the time in their rest periods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.2: Domain Model with Description<br />Our project is a 2D platformer with a retro art style. Since we are creating a video game we will be facing a variety of different problems in order to create a cohesive user experience. The main issues we are facing are creating visually-appealing artwork, an easy-to-use user interface, and solid game mechanics. The main problems can be broken down further into sub-problems that our team will work to fix. In a lot of ways, artwork and the user interface go hand-in-hand as they both directly contribute to the user&rsquo;s perceived polish of the game and how user friendly the game is/appears. Regarding the artwork, our team will work to create engaging backgrounds for each level of our game, visually captivating enemy and player modes, menu and sub menu artwork, and smooth animations that create a more enjoyable user experience. With regard to the user interface, our team will have to create a main menu and pause menu that is easy to navigate. Within the main menu we will have sub-menus that allow the user to change graphics settings, audio settings, and even map different controls to allow for a customizable gaming experience. The main issue with UI design is creating an interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate so our team will have to pay extra attention to ease-of-use and perform rigorous testing. Game mechanics can be broken down into smaller problems such as level design, player abilities, and artificial intelligence. Our level design will face problems such as creating gameplay that flows for the player and is easy to follow so the player can get from point A to point B without frustration. Player abilities are a major issue that will require a large dedication of time to fix. Problems that we will face in developing player abilities include creating unique and novel player mechanics that keep our player engaged, such as attack abilities, movement abilities, and other miscellaneous mechanics such as a health system and special abilities. Artificial intelligence will have different issues such as being intelligent to the extent that our player stays engaged. AI will have to be able to spawn in different locations, follow set paths, and follow the player. It will also have to be able to use different attacks and have different abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.3: Product Functions (general)<br />This product includes the ability to be played on any computer system that has the capability of downloading the Godot engine. This means that the product is accessible to a high number of individuals if they have access to a capable computer. This product also has the capability of showing the player an authentic gaming experience with a variety of enemies, movement options, and elements in the game&rsquo;s world that make it come to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.4: User Characteristics and Expectations<br />Our users are mostly constituted of people interested in videogame media. This means that a large portion of it is comprised of people who test the game and make sure there are no inconsistencies. Another portion of it is made up of game reviewers who look at the specific features of a game and rate them based on overall good design. These users have the capability of seeing what the current iteration of the product is and posting their own thoughts and ideas about them in our user stories page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.5: Constraints<br />One of the main constraints our system has is that we cannot add elements to it that would not constitute something that tends to be part of a platformer game. Of course, we can add features to our game that are new or unfamiliar if they make sense for the overall theme and genre of the game. Another constraint our system has is that we need to always account for the way that a player will move throughout the game and verify that we don&rsquo;t accidentally make a portion that can cause the player to be unable to make progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.6: Assumptions and Dependencies<br />Since our software runs in the Godot engine specifically, we are assuming that anyone who will use this software has the capability of downloading this engine. Another assumption we make is that the user is already equipped with knowledge as to what a platformer game should be like. This is assumed so that we can automatically infer that the user already knows how the game is supposed to progress forward and what they can do to make it happen.</p>
